# Sorting Algorithm Comparison üïπÔ∏è
The experiment depicts a comparative study of five sorting algorithms, aiming to illustrate the behavior of sorting algorithms and serve as a guideline for selecting the most efficient algorithm based on the characteristics of real-world data.

## Dataset Selection
The Test cases have been generated based on the characteristics of real-world data to ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the sorting algorithms
- Random-Ordered Unique Data
- Random Normal Distribution Data
- Normal Distribution Data with Varying Standard Deviations
- Sorted Data Datasets
  
## Sorting Algorithm Selection guideline
![Guideline](https://i.imgur.com/4lxtg1z.png)

The sorting algorithm selection guideline has been formulated based on our comparative study using a large test set. In datasets with fewer than 10,000 elements
